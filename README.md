# VSY_Game_Project
tic tac toe game where two players can play with each other

to start the game first make sure to install the tkinter  lib.

"pip install tkinter.py"

to start gaming start the  main server:

"python mainserver.py"

if u run the mainserver again u will get it binded with another port:

"python agentserver.py"

after starting mainserver and agent u should be able to start the game:
"python game.py "

u can run it again to get the other player

after that press connect to the agent the press play to tell the server that u want to play.

the server will send once he has found player mate to ypu.

the main reason reason why this project was devolped was that we have another server alive which will take the job after the main server is down and the user wont notice that there was down in the servers
